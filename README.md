As COVID-19 continues to spread around the world leaving economic upheaval in its wake, we have focused on analyzing the economic impact of Sub-Saharan Africa which will eventually help the concerned government to build a road plan. Specifically, government can introduce more aids and instantiate laid off workers from traditional job markets to a post-pandemic job markets specially for those people who are highly concerned about carrying out their expenses for the upcoming months.
Here, as we are using supervised learning to classify people of Sub-Saharan Africa in terms of their expression of expense concern due to COVID-19 for the upcoming months based on the social factors, the most important features which have been used for predicting the concern expense rating will also provide important insights for the government while taking consideration of any new initiative to address the needy people and build the economy.
We use association rule mining of unsupervised learning to identify the most frequent attributes and the common rules observed in the dataset. These frequent features can help to target the people who should be the primary focus from the concerned Government’s program in the process of rebuilding the economy in post COVID-19 time. Our findings from the classifier model and the association rule mining can contribute to help the government of local province in Sub-Saharan Africa as well as country wise to construct their economic rebuilding roadmaps in the post pandemic time and also provide them important insights to be used for their different aid programs as well targeting the correct people.
We believe that post COVID-19, it is very important to address specific people who are in mostly need of economic help to instantiate the economy and this data-mining project will be useful in that aspect. Finding a solution to the ongoing crisis makes this project interesting. Developing a model to find the economic concern of a person based on social factors of the person and using rule mining to find out the association between these factors makes our project novel.
In the following section, we will be going to perform two data-mining tasks: (a) for supervised learning , we will build the classifier model to estimate the rating which is expressed on the scale of 1 to 5 for the concern of expenses in upcoming six months and (b) unsupervised learning – we will use association rule mining on different combination of the available features (with different support and confidence values) and identify association rules of various socio-economic factors. Here we have not used any clustering algorithm as most of our features in the dataset are categorical and we feel that clustering will not be that meaningful to interpret some useful insights from the data.
For both the algorithms we start by considering all features and proceed by eliminating the variables that may not be important to us. The detailed description of type of variables used is mentioned in the corresponding algorithm implementation section.
